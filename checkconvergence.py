def checkconvergence(popu,cb='no'):
    '''This function is used to check if the system has already converged or not (meaning it has reached one of the possible final states,
    and this state won't change anymore). It serves as an important part of newrunargsimforprofiling, our main simulation function, since it
    allows us to use a while loop, and use the necessary steps to converge, no more and no less. Its input is a population of agents popu, and
    the presence of confirmation bias (cb='yes') or its abscence (cb='no'). Since the final states are determined by looking only at the opinion
    of the agents, this is the main determinant of convergence: if opinions can't change, the system has converged (even if it would need some more
    steps to reach posture convergence. NOTE: postures are called persuasions in all the codes.'''
